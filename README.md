# 🏢 Small Office Network Project

## 📘 Overview

- **2 Routers (Router-PT)** – configured with *static routing* to interconnect HR and Sales departments.  
- **2 Switches (Switch-PT)** – used to connect end devices and servers within each department.  
- **4 PCs** – two PCs for each department to simulate employee workstations.  
- **2 Servers (Server-PT)** – generic Packet Tracer servers configured for basic local services and testing connectivity between departments.
